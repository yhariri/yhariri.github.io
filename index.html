  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <strong>About</strong><br>
    I bring over 17 years of experience developing and deploying advanced systems at the intersection of AI, IoT, embedded computing, and the cloud-to-edge continuum. My focus is on enabling real-time, distributed intelligence by integrating AI with IoT, turning research into deployable solutions. I’m committed to building scalable, reusable platforms that empower researchers, startups, and industry to deliver meaningful impact across sectors such as green tech, EVs, smart health, precision agriculture, Industry 4.0, and defence.
